"""Choose a program to build:

- Even or Odd Checker: Enter a number, and the program tells you if itâ€™s even or odd using % and conditionals.

- Simple Chatbot: Respond to basic greetings or phrases using if/elif logic.

1. Write out the pseudocode for your chosen task in a docstring.
2. Document the description of the code with comments
3. Name your objects with the snake case format.
4. Use the various data types to store your data in the named variable.
5. Use built-in functions at your discretion e.g. print() , input()
