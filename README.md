## Background
Python is an object-oriented coding language that was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. Python is famed for its human readability making it an ideal first language to learn. From there learning other coding languages can become easier to grasp. Python is a popular progamming language today that you can find in Web Development, AI and Data Science to name a few.

You might be wondering to what does object-oriented programming (OOP) refer. Python is called an object-oriented language because it lets us group data and actions together into something called an "object" Think of an object as what you would find in the real world. For example, a cat has information such as its name, breed and age. The cat also has actions such as sleeping, meowing and scratching.

In Python you can create a class which acts as a general blueprint and name it, for example, cat. Then make objects from it, for example, Snowbell and Merv. This helps keep your code neat and easy to reuse, especially as your programs grow. Now don't worry if this sounds a bit like gibberish. OOP is a topic that is explored after you have advanced your knowledge as a beginner.

# Building Blocks of Python

## Psuedocode
Psuedocode is an informal method of stating what you want the code to do. Here you visual the task and the steps to complete it. Essentially this is the plan for an algorithm carried out by a computer. That is to say algorithms are the steps. Ensure that the algorithm has an input, output and very clear steps. Now bear in mind that this is simply planning and not the actual coding language. Psuedocode guides the comments you will document to explain the actual Python code.

E.g.

*Problem: write a program that prints "even" or "odd" depending on whether the number input is divisable by two without a remainder.*

+ Psuedocode solution (with no particular format):

    ```
    request an integer input from the user
    
    store the input in a variable named, "number"

    check that the input was an integer

    if the "number" was not an integer

        request new input

    else

        store the result as "quotient"

        divide the "number" by 2 to calculate the "quotient"

    if the "quotient" is zero

        store the "interpretation" as even

        print out "interpretation"

    else

        store the "interpretation" as odd

        print out "interpretation"
    ```

**Go to session_1_task.py and complete the psuedocode for your selected task**

+ Open your codespace.
+ Install Python if prompted by a pop-up.
+ Open the command prompt terminal (should open automatically).
+ Navigate to the directory containing the first task.
+ Run the following commands to navigate there:
    + `dir` and Enter to check your directory contains the README.md and Building Blocks of Python.
    + `cd Buil` followed by the tab button to automatically fill the directory and then press Enter.
        + if you don't have a keyboard, type the full `cd Building\ Blocks\ of\ Python/` and press Enter.
    + `dir` again and Enter to check if you can find session_1_task.py in the list of files output.
    + `code session_1_task.py` to open the file or click on the file name in the left side panel.

## Comments 

A comment is an explanation of Python code and it can be placed anywhere in a Python program. The comment is always ignored by the computer while running the code and is solely meant for the human reading the file. Write a comment in a Python program by adding a '#' at the start of the line. 

E.g. 

`# This is a comment`

There are two types of comments depending on the their placement.
If you want the comment to precede your code, refer to it as a block comment. A comment can also be placed on the same line as the code, after it, as an inline comment.

E.g.

`# This is a block comment`

`print("Hello,world")`

E.g.

`print("Hello,world") # This is an inline comment`

+ **Go to session_1_task.py and complete the comments for your selected task**

## Variables
A Python variable can be described as the location where data was stored. A variable is the name of the data that will be used to refer to the data during an algorithm. Ensure the following when naming a variable:

1. Use only lowercase letters.

1. Use snake case for longer variable names, e.g. number_of_pets, acccording to the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) 8 style guide. Thus, replace spaces with undercores.

1. Use a descriptive name relevant to the program algorithm created and to the value it refers.

1. A variable name may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores. However, it may only begin with either a letter or underscore.

1. A Python keyword cannot be used as variable name, e.g. print = "Sam". It was predefined and cannot be redefined by a coder. Python will pick it up as the function to which it may refer.

E.g.

`cat = "Snowball"`

Variables are useful in keeping track of different information. _From the example above, cat is the variable name which stores the cat name "Snowball" as data._ 

There are various **data types** from which you can consider using as you assign data to a variable. These can comprise:
1. Char
1. String
1. Integer
1. Float
1. Boolean

### Char

A char refers to a single character. This could be a letter, number, punctuation or special character. For example, A, 2, !, #.
You could use a char to store the grade for a student, for example, `grade = "B"; people = 3`.

### String

A string is a list of characters. For example, use it to store a name as `cat = "Snowball"`. Python detects a string with the presence of inverted commas ("").

### Integer

An integer is a whole number (i.e. no decimal or fraction included). For example, store the number of students at a career fair as `num_of_students = 56`. Python detects an integer by the presence of a whole number.

### Float
A float is a number that contains a decimal amount, for example, `cost = 14.90`. Python detects a float by the presence of a decimal point.

### Boolean
A boolean can only store one of two values - either True or False. This means that an outcome only has two possibities. Note the **capitalisation** of a boolean. Python only recognises a boolean with its capitalised value.

**Check the data type of a variable with the built-in type() function**

E.g. 

```
num_of_students = 56
print(type(num_of_students))  # output: <class 'int'>
```

E.g. 

```
num_of_students = "56"
print(type(num_of_students))  # output: <class 'str'>
```

_Take note of the above example._ You may find yourself with an error because the data type used through out your algorithm cannot perform certain actions. For example, you cannot perform mathematical operations on a number stored as a string. 
The solution? Cast your data type. This essentially means converting your data type.

These are the available casting functions:
1. int()
1. str()
1. float()

An argument is the value that the casting commands will use to act. Simply place the variable name as the argument inside the brackets. 

E.g.
```
num_of_students = "56"
convert_num_of_students = int(num_of_students)
print(type(convert_num_of_students)) # output: <class 'int'>
```

The above conversion will allow for addition operations, for example:

```
invited_guests = 29
plus_1_guests = "13"
total_guests = invited_guests + int(plus_1_guests)
print(total_guests) # output: 42
```


### Input and Output

Another important part of an algorithm is the **input and output**. A user sends input to the computer via a mouse, keyboard or touchpad. Output is the information a computer displays to the user after being transferred from it via a screen, printer or audio device.

Lets look at the previous algorithm to identify the input and output.

E.g.

*Problem: write a program that prints "even" or "odd" depending on whether the number input is divisable by two without a remainder.*

+ Psuedocode solution (with no particular format):

    ```
    request an integer input from the user
    
    store the input in a variable named, "number"

    check that the input was an integer

    if the "number" was not an integer

        request new input

    else

        store the result as "quotient"

        divide the "number" by 2 to calculate the "quotient"

    if the "quotient" is zero

        store the "interpretation" as even

        print out "interpretation"

    else

        store the "interpretation" as odd

        print out "interpretation"
    ```

From the above example, input is the "number" and output is "interpretation."

### **How to get input and output**

Now I am going to introduce you to a few built-in Python functions:

+ `input()`
+ `print()`

As a programmer, there may come time when you need a user's input. Place the input function in your code when you require the user to enter information with a keyboard. Store the information with a variable name to use it later in the program.

E.g.

`breed = input("What is the breed of your cat?: ")`

Notice the variable name "breed", the input function and the argument placed within the brackets. An argument is the value that the input command will use to act.

The information a user inputs automatically stores as a string data type (i.e. a list of characters). Moreover, you can also cast the string variable type that was entered via input(), so that you can use it later in the program's code. See the examples below:

E.g.

`num_of_pets = int(input("How many pets do you have?: "))`

`vac_cost = float(input("How much does it cost to vaccinate your cat?: "))`

+ _**Note that the program pauses until after the user enters information and presses Enter**_

The print function will display information to the user on a screen.

E.g.

`print(breed)` # will output the breed variable that the user entered.

E.g. 

`print("Hello, World!")` # will output the sentence in the argument.

### Print out variables within a string

You can use a formatted string or 'f-string' to print out a string containing the values of variables that has been saved.
It is important that the print argument:
1. Starts with the shortened 'f' indicating format, 
1. Opens and closes the inverted commas, and 
1. Has '{}' containing the variable name.

E.g.

print(f"The cost to vaccinate the cat was R{vac_cost}")

### Overwrite variables

If you decide to change the value previously stored in a variable, during an algorithm as your program runs, it is fairly easy. Simply use the '=' to assign a new value.

E.g.

```
breed = "tabbie"
print(breed)  # output: tabbie

breed = "ragdoll"
print(breed)  # output: ragdoll
```

Python will always use the lastest value saved in a variable - bear in mind that the code runs line by line from top to bottom.

### **_An important note on syntax_**

The way you write your code will make or break the running of a Python program. Python has syntax rules that, when you do not follow them, a syntax error raises in your terminal.

Some common syntax errors include:
+ Not closing a bracket, for example, `print("Hello, World!"`
+ Not closing the inverted commas, for example, `print("Hello, World!)`
+ Incorrect case, for example, `Print("Hello, World!")`

Python is case-sensitive so be sure to check your uppercase and lowercase letter placements.

If an error occurs and the program fails, follow up with debugging. Debugging is the process to resolve the error. The terminal will name the type of error (e.g. SyntaxError) and the line where the error occurs. This is very helpful to locate and update the code to ensure that the program runs uninterrupted.

## Data Structures

### Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are the ways one can organize, store, and manage data efficiently. The choice of data structure depends on the type of data you have and what you plan to do with it. In the python documentation linked below you‚Äôll see that data structures include lists, dictionaries (also known as hash maps), sets, and tuples.

Today we are going to look at two common data stuctures: list and dictionary

### The List

#### When to use a List?

Lists are a great choice when you want an ordered collection of items. Here are a few examples where you may find lists particularly useful:

1.	**Ordered Data**: When the order of elements matters.
1.	**Index-based Access**: When you need to frequently access elements by their position.
1.	**Mixed Data Types**: When you need to store elements of different data types.
1.	**Dynamic Size**: When you need to add or remove items frequently.

Let's see how we can create and manipulate lists.

#### Creating a List

You can create a list by naming an object and entering your values within square brackets `[]`, separated by commas. Now remember, Lists can store different data types simultaneously, including even other lists.

```
# Example list with Marvel characters and attributes
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

# Print the lists
print(f"avengers list:\t {avengers_info}") # output: ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

# confirm you have created a list
print(f"{type(avengers_info)}")  # output: <class 'list'>
```

+ **Go to session_1_task.py and create a list for your selected task**

#### Access List Elements

Lists are sequence types, meaning their elements are ordered and accessible via indexing. **Note** that the index for the first element is 0.

That means that the index position from left to right is: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

Conversely, indexing from right to left uses negative indexes that start from 1: [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1]

Negative indexes are best for when you want an element at the end of a long list.

```
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

# Access the first element of the avengers list
print(avengers_info[0])  
# Output: Iron Man
```

#### Slicing a List

If you need to return more than one element, slicing a list can help. Just specify the start and end index separated by a colon (:). **Note**: the end index is excluded from the output.

```
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

# Slicing the avengers list
print(f"idx 1:3-> {avengers_info[1:3]}")  # Output: [3000, 'Thor']

# if you leave either a start index, end index or both indexes blank, it will slice from the start, up to the end or from the complete start to end of the list
# slice last 2 elements
print(f"Last 2 elements: {avengers_info[-2:]}")  # Output: [34.5, 6]

# slice first 2 elements
print(f"First 2 elements: {avengers_info[:2]}")  # Output: ["Iron Man", 3000]

# slice the whole list
print(f"All the elements: {avengers_info[:]}")  # Output: ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]
```

#### Modify a List

Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements using list methods or by overwriting the element at a specific index.

```
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

# Overwrite an element
avengers_info[2] = "Captain America"

print(avengers_info)  # Output: ["Iron Man", 3000, "Captain America", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

```

#### Changing the Size of a List

You can also change the size of a list using list methods like `append()`, `pop()`, and `extend()`.

```
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

# Grow the avengers list with append()
avengers_info.append("Hawkeye")

print(avengers_info)  # Output: ["Iron Man", 3000, "Captain America", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6, ‚ÄúHawkeye‚Äù]
```

```
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

# Remove an element with pop()
avengers_info.pop(1)

print(avengers_info)  # Output: ["Iron Man", "Captain America", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6, ‚ÄúHawkeye‚Äù]
```

```
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

additional_heroes = ["Ant-Man", "Wasp", "Doctor Strange"]

# Extend the list
avengers_info.extend(additional_heroes)

print(avengers_info)  # Output: ["Iron Man", "Captain America", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6, "Hawkeye", "Ant-Man", "Wasp", "Doctor Strange"]
```

So there you have it! We've explored the basics of lists in Python using our Marvel heroes example. There's much more to discover about lists, including advanced methods and operations.

### The Dictionary

A dictionary can be used to store data. Each item in a dictionary has a key and a value. Whereas an index can access a value in a list, a dictionary key accesses its value.

#### When to use a Dictionary?

Dictionaries are a great choice when you want an unordered collection of items (i.e. the order in which data enters is not preserved). Here are a few examples where you may find dictionaries particularly useful:

1. A quick lookup of data via key access (i.e. it takes the same amount of time regardless of the data set size, O(1))
1. You want named attributes 
1. You need to add or update data
1. You work with JSON or APIs

#### Create a Dictionary

Now let's see how you can create a dictionary.
Your checklist:
+ Use curly brackets {} to encompass the data.
+ Assign a key-value pair, seperated by a colon(:).
+ Seperate the items by a comma.
+ Items can use any data type, however, the key must be immutable (i.e. not a list or dictionary capable of changing).
+ The key must be **unique**.

E.g.
```
pet_breed = {
    "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
    "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
}
```

Alternatively, if you already have a data set in a list, use the dictionary method [dict()] to cast it to a dictionary.

E.g.
```
pet_breed = dict([
    ["Snowball", "Ragdoll"],
    ["Beethoven", "Saint Bernard"]
    ])
```

#### Access Dictionary Elements

There are a few ways to retrieve a value:
+ Place the key inside of the square brackets:
    ```
    pet_breed = {
        "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
        "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
    }

    print(pet_breed["Snowball"]) # output: "Ragdoll"
    ```

+ Use the get() method:
    ```
    pet_breed = {
        "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
        "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
    }
    
    print(pet_breed.get("Snowball")) # output: "Ragdoll"
    ```

You could also retrieve all the keys or values in a dictionary with their respective methods.

E.g.
```
pet_breed = {
    "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
    "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
}
keys = pet_breed.keys() # use the key method on the dictionary

print(keys) # output: dict_keys(["Snowball", "Beethoven"])
```

E.g.
```
pet_breed = {
    "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
    "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
}

values = pet_breed.values() # use the value method on the dictionary

print(values)  # output: dict_values(["Ragdoll", "Saint Bernard"])
```

#### Modify a Dictionary

Simply use the assignment operator '=' to update a dictionary item. Similary, you can add a new dictionary item with the same step.

E.g.
```
pet_breed = {
    "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
    "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
}

# index the dict key and assign new value
pet_breed["Snowball"] = "Tabbie" 

print(pet_breed) # output: {"Snowball": "Tabbie", "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",}

```

E.g.
```
pet_breed = {
    "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
    "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
}

# add a new dict item
pet_breed["Chompers"] = "Dalmatian"

print(pet_breed) # output: {"Snowball": "Tabbie", "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard", "Chompers": "Dalmatian"}
```

#### Use a Boolean to Check for a Dictionary Key

Use the 'in' keyword to check for a dictionary key.

```
pet_breed = {
    "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
    "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
}

print("Beethoven" in pet_breed)  # output: True
```

# Making Python Think ‚Äì Logic & Flow

##  Control Stuctures (if, elif, else) ‚Äì teaching code how to make decisions

I am going to start off today's session by introducing conditional statements. A computer will make the decision to run specific blocks of code depending on if-statements. 

### If

The if-statements will compare variables and complete an action based on the outcome.

An important note is the structure of the code under a conditional statement. An error raises if there are missing or misplaced indents. In Python use the tab button (equivalent to four spaces) to indent the code under an if-statement.

E.g.
```
people = 23

if people < 30:
    print("The guest list has not filled up yet.")
```

The print statement will only display if the condition is True (referencing the boolean data type).

Notice the syntax of a conditional statement:
1. Start with the 'if' keyword
1. A comparison operator
1. End the conditional statement with a colon (:)
1. The indented code indicates the path the computer will take if the condition evaluates to True
1. _Extra:_ if you have a particularly long statement, you can place the condition in brackets for better readability. E.g. `if (people < 30):`

### Comparison operators 

The comparison operators used in conditionals include:
1. < less than
1. `>` greater than
1. == equal to
1. ! not
1. <= less than or equal to
1. `>=` greater than or equal to
1. != not equal to

The if-statement will check if a condition outcome is True or False. For example, if a new password is valid.

Let's have a look at assigning booleans to variables in a control structure.

E.g.
```
pet = "Play inside."

sunny = False

if sunny: # this is shorthand for if sunny == True (redundant to write out as the default is True)
    pet = "Go for a walk."
```

### Else

An else-statement takes the computer along a path to follow when an if-statement evaluates to False. This the 'else' keyword presents an alternative route. Simply use the word 'else' to create the conditional statement.

E.g.
```
if condition:
    indented code

else:
    indented code
```

Notice the syntax of an 'else' conditional statement:
1. Else is always after the if-statement.
1. Only use the keyword 'else.'
1. End the conditional statement with a colon (:).
1. The indented code indicates the path the computer will take if the condition evaluates to False.

E.g.
```
date = 41

# check if the date falls within the July month
if 1 < date < 31:
    print("Accepted")

else:
    print("Invalid date") # skips if-statement & executes else-statement output
```

The else-statement will give us some feedback instead of a blank terminal.

### Elif

The last conditional statement is one we use when you want to check for multiple conditions. Elif is the shortened form of else-if. There can only be one if-statement and else-statement but many elif-statements. 

E.g.
```
date = 41

# check if the date falls within the July month
if 1 <= date <= 31:
    print("Accepted")

elif date > 31:
    print("The date input is too high")

elif date < 1:
    print("That date input is too low")

else:
    print("Invalid date") # skips if-statement & executes else-statement output
```

The computer evaluates each condition to see if it's True and only checks the next condition if it's False. **_Note_** the order of the control structure:
1. if
1. elif
1. else

## Performing math operations within conditionals

### Mathematical Operations

As you may recall from the first session, Python automatically picks up the number data type you save to a variable name. Futhermore, mathematical operations with different values have to be of the same data type to run successfully. This is where casting becomes a necessity.

Performing calculations in Python is similar to the methods used in normal math.

E.g.
```
# add integers
total = 3 + 4

print(total) # output: 7
```

E.g.
```
# add floats
cost = 3.5 + 2.1

print(cost) # output: 5.6
```

E.g.
```
# deduct int
total = 3 - 4

print(total) # output: -1
```

E.g.
```
# calculate the product of int
total = 3 * 4

print(total) # output: 12
```

E.g.
```
# calculate the quotient of int
total = 3 / 4

print(total) # output: 0.75
```

E.g.
```
# find the remainder of integer division via modulus operation
remainder = 5 % 2 # Divide the value left of the operator by the value on the right to return the remainder

print(remainder) # output: 1
```
_**Note**: modulus can help identify even and odd numbers._

E.g.
```
# calculate an exponential value
result = 3 ** 2 # the exponent power is on the right

print(result) # output: 9
```

**Optional Reading**: As you advance with your learning, you may be interested to learn about the math library import and how you can use it in your code.

**Now let's do a calculation within a control structure!**

E.g.
```
# add integers
total = 3 + 4

# calculate the remainder after diving by 3
remainder = total % 3

if remainder < 1:
    print("That's not much")

elif 1 <= remainder >= 3  
    print("Ok not bad")

else:
    print("Oof that's a bit much")

```

## Loops (for, while) ‚Äì automating repetitive tasks

### while loop

First we will look at while loops. Within a while loop, a block of code repeats until a condition becomes False. That is to say an action repeats while a condition is True. The syntax starts with the while keyword followed by a Boolean statement. End the line with a colon and start the repeatable code on the next line, after an indent. Remember: Python is syntax specific - you will get an error if a tab (equivalent to 4 spaces) is not there. A while statement is tested at the start before repeating the actionable code.

```
while boolean expression:
    statement(s)
```

E.g.
```
people = 10

while people > 1:
    people = people - 1 # alternative shorthand: people -= 1
    print(people)
```

The while loop will ensure one deducts from people until there are 2 people. The latest value for people is stored in memory until the value is overwritten in the next while loop iteration.

Note: It is important to ensure a loop reaches a False condition or you risk running into an infinite loop. The loops exits one a condition is False.

### for loop

Next we have the for loop. A for loop, similar to a while loop, also repeats code until a condition is False. However, the number of repetitions are known ahead of time. The for loop has a start value which counts up to the end value.

Note the syntax. The keywords Python picks are 'for' and 'in.' The for statement ends with a colon and the repeatable actions follows indented on the next line.
```
for index_variable in sequence: 
    statements 
```

Lets use Python's built-in range function to set a start and end point for the repeatable code.

E.g.
```
for i in range(2, 10):
    print(i)
```

In Python you can use a placeholder name to refer to each value the for loop statement will test for True. People often use 'i' or 'j'.

## Combining logic with lists and dictionaries

You can also iterate over items in a list.
E.g.
```
avengers_info = ["Iron Man", 3000, "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", 34.5, 6]

for info in avengers_info:
    print(info)
```

Lets have a look at looping through a dictionary. You can use the built-in items() method to iterate over a key-value pair (i.e. item) in a dictionary. Note the syntax includes the dictionary name followed by the dictionary items method (i.e. function). You leave the brackets empty.
E.g.
```
pet_breed = {
    "Snowball": "Ragdoll",
    "Beethoven": "Saint Bernard",
}

for key, value in pet_breed.items():
    print(key, value)
```

# Learning consolidation ‚Äì Project

For our final session, we are going to build a mini-project that brings together everything from Sessions 1 and 2. The goal is to reinforce the understanding of:

+	Data types (str, int, float, bool)
+	Collections (list, dict)
+	Logic & flow (if, else, for, while)
+	Real-world problem-solving with code

I will provide a project brief and you will have the opportunity to work on it in your codespace. You can ask questions in the comments, and I will assist you as needed.

## Define a function

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help us avoid repetition and make our code more organised.

The syntax for defining a function in Python is:
```
def function_name():
    coding logic  
```
The 'def' keyword indicates that we are defining a function. The function name follows, and it is followed by parentheses. The indented code block contains the logic that the function will execute when called.

Now remember that in a Python program, the computer will read your code but not execute it unless you call the function. You can call the function by using its name followed by parentheses.

```
# define a function
def function_name():
    coding logic  

# call the function
function_name()
```

*Lets look at an example program*
```
def greeting():
    print("Hello, world!")

greeting()
```

The program defines a function called 'greeting' and prints "Hello, world!" when called. Then the function was called and the output was displayed.

## More on built-in functions

We have previously looked at built-in functions such as input(), print() and range(). Now I am going to introduce you to some string methods. 

### Check length
You can check the length of a string using the built-in len() function. It returns the number of characters in the string.

E.g.
```
pet_breed = "Ragdoll"

pet_breed_length = len(pet_breed)

print(pet_breed_length) # output 7
```

### Check a Character

You can check if a character is present in a string using the 'in' keyword. It returns True if the character is found, otherwise False.

Check for an uppercase letter:

E.g.
```
# set a char to check for an uppercase letter
pet_breed = "R"

# use the method to check for an uppercase letter
uppercase_check = pet_breed.isupper() # method returns True or False

# print out the boolean check
print(uppercase_check) # output True
```

Check for an lowercase letter:

E.g.
```
# set a char to check for a lowercase letter
pet_breed = "R"

# use the method to check for an lowercase letter
lowercase_check = pet_breed.islower() # method returns True or False

# print out the boolean check
print(lowercase_check) # output False
```

Check for a number:

E.g.
```
# set a char to check for a number
number = "3"

# use the method to check for a number
number_check = number.isdigit() # method returns True or False

# print out the boolean check
print(number_check) # output True
```

Check for alphanumeric characters (i.e. letters and numbers).

E.g.
```
band_name = "4ll4mericanRejects"

# use alphanumeric method to check that an objects contains both letters and numbers.
alphanumeric_check = band_name.isalnum() # method returns True or False

# print out the boolean check
print(alphanumeric_check) # output False
```

## More on conditional statements

**Check for multiple conditions in a single if-statement**

You can combine multiple conditions in a single if-statement using logical operators. The logical operators include:

1. and - True if both conditions are True
1. or - True if at least one condition is True
1. not - True if the condition is False

E.g.
```
pet_type = "Dog"
pet_breed = "Saint Bernard"

# check for a pet type and pet breed
# print out the pet type and pet breed
# print out and error response for an unknown pet type and pet breed
if pet_type == "Dog" and pet_breed == "Saint Bernard":
    print("You have a Saint Bernard dog!")

elif pet_type == "Cat" or pet_breed == "Ragdoll":
    print("You have a cat or a Ragdoll breed!")

else:
    print("Unknown pet type or breed.")

```

## Project time

Now is your opportunity to attempt the session 3 project! Open the Learning consolidation folder and remember to run your program to test it. Feel free to ask questions!
