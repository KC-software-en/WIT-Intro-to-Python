# Introduction to Python Programming for Beginners ‚Äì Women in Tech Edition 

üêç Welcome to the Intro to Python Workshop! This beginner-friendly repo is your launchpad into Python programming‚Äîpacked with hands-on exercises, clear examples, and everything you need to start coding with confidence. 

**Note: Participants will need a free GitHub account to access the online development environment. The class code and exercises will be hosted in a GitHub repository, and a Visual Studio Code Codespace will be available for everyone ‚Äì no setup required!**

## Background
Python is an object-oriented coding language that was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. Python is famed for its human readability making it an ideal first language to learn. From there learning other coding languages can become easier to grasp. Python is a popular progamming language today that you can find in Web Development, AI and Data Science to name a few.

You might be wondering to what does object-oriented programming (OOP) refer. Python is called an object-oriented language because it lets us group data and actions together into something called an "object" Think of an object as what you would find in the real world. For example, a cat has information such as its name, breed and age. The cat also has actions such as sleeping, meowing and scratching.

In Python you can create a class which acts as a general blueprint and name it, for example, cat. Then make objects from it, for example, Snowbell and Merv. This helps keep your code neat and easy to reuse, especially as your programs grow. Now don't worry if this sounds a bit like gibberish. OOP is a topic that is explored after you have advanced your knowledge as a beginner.

## Psuedocode
Psuedocode is an informal method of stating what you want code to do. Here you visual the task and the steps to complete it. Essentially this is the plan for an algorithm carried out by a computer. That is to say algorithms are the steps. Now bear in mind that this is simply planning and not the actual coding language. Psuedocode guides the comments you will document to explain the actual Python code.

E.g.

*Problem: write a program that prints "even" or "odd" depending on whether the number input is divisable by two without a remainder.*

Psuedocode solution (with particular format):

request a number from the user

check that the input was a number

if the input was not a number
    
    request new input

else
    
    divide the input by 2

if the result is zero
    
    print even

else
    
    print odd
